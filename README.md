This is a rewrite of last season's robot by code division members who want more practice.
Our goals for this off season project (In order of priority are):
游릴 = done and working fully 游릳 = almost done 游릲 = started work 游린 = not started

1. Make the robot drive without the use of a swerve library 游릴
2. Get subsystems working (including Climbers, Sprocket, and Intake) 游릲
3. Autonomous driving with path planer (Hopefully with limelight vision) 游린
4. Get the full process of In-taking and shooting notes to fully function. (Should be able to do it at least reliably, but not necessarily accurately as that would take a lot of time for testing that we don't have) 游린
5. Pose estimation with limelight 游린
6. Working LED system 游린
7. In Motion Scoring 游린
