This is a rewrite of last seasons robot by code division memberes who want more practice.
Our goles for this off season project (In order of priority are):

1. Make the robot drive (Hopefully without the use of a swerve library allthough we may abaondon that)
2. Get subsystems working (including Climberes, Sproket, and Intake)
3. Autonomous driving with pathplaner (Hopfully with limelight vision)
4. Get the full prossese of Intaking and shooting notes to fully function. (Should be able to do it at least reliably but not necessarily accurately)
5. Pose estimation with limelights
6. Working LED system
7. In Motion Scoring
