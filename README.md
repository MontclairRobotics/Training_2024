This is a rewrite of last season's robot by code division members who want more practice.
Our goals for this off season project (In order of priority are):

1. Make the robot drive (Hopefully without the use of a swerve library, although we may abandon that)
2. Get subsystems working (including Climbers, Sprocket, and Intake)
3. Autonomous driving with path planer (Hopefully with limelight vision)
4. Get the full process of In-taking and shooting notes to fully function. (Should be able to do it at least reliably, but not necessarily accurately)
5. Pose estimation with limelight
6. Working LED system
7. In Motion Scoring
